# Clicky Pokemon Game - [React Site](http://oc-clicky-game.herokuapp.com/)
A memory style game. Each time you click on a Pokemon, the cards will shuffle and your score increases by 1. If you click on the same Pokemon twice, you lose! If your score beat the top score it will become the new top score, and the current score resets to 0.

## Technologies/Frameworks used:
Here are the technologies that you need to install 
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) An open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* Node Modules:
    * [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.

## State and Props
* State should be stored in a parent component with properties (or props) passed to child components.
* To change state from a child component, the parent component passes a function as a prop for the child to use.
* .setState({}) is used to modify the current state.

## Programmer's Notes
* Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm](https://github.com/coolaj86/knuth-shuffle) to shuffle an array of objects everytime a card is clicked.
* `.indexOf()` method to find the current index of Pokemon object array using the clicked Pokemon's **ID**, which we then modify the specific object's `clicked` value to `true`.











This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
